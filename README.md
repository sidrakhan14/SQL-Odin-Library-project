# SQL-Odin-Library-project

Overview:
This project focuses on analyzing a Library Management System using SQL.
The dataset used is Odin Library, and all queries were executed in MySQL Workbench.
The main goal of this project was to extract meaningful insights such as top readers, most borrowed books, popular categories, and yearly borrowing trends.

Objectives:
	•	Understand how data is stored and managed in a library database.
	•	Perform analysis using SELECT, GROUP BY, JOIN, ORDER BY, and aggregate functions.
	•	Retrieve information such as most borrowed books, top active members, and category-wise borrowing frequency.

Tools Used:
  •	MySQL Workbench

Files Included in this Repository:
	1.	SQL_Project_Report.pdf — Project report explaining all SQL queries, results, and insights.
	2.	SQL_Project_Presentation.pptx — PowerPoint presentation summarizing the findings.

Key Insights:
	•	Found top 10 books with highest borrow count.
	•	Identified most active library members.
	•	Analyzed borrowing trends by category and year.
	•	Helped understand data-driven improvements for library operations.

How to Use:
This repository includes the final report and presentation of the project.
Since the Odin Library dataset is not publicly available, queries cannot be directly executed.
The PDF report already includes all SQL queries and their results, so anyone can understand the analysis without running the code.
